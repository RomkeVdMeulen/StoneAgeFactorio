stoneage-msg-intro=So, you are going to need to build a rocket to get out of here. You'll need the right tools to do that, but right now you have only your bare hands. Now let's see... what around here looks fragile enough that you can break it down with just your hands?

[entity-name]
campfire=Campfire
charcoal-pile=Charcoal pile
clay-patch=Clay patch
kiln=Kiln
mixing-pit=Mixing pit
sandy-patch=Sandy patch
wood-pipe=Wooden pipe
wood-pump=Wooden pump

[entity-description]
campfire=A managable fireplace that can be used for some simple crafting, or to hopefully keep biters away.
charcoal-pile=It is a mount of soil: you bury burning wood in it, and it turns into charcoal.
clay-patch=This terrain is rich in dried up clay. With the right tool, it could easily be dug up.
mixing-pit=A hole in the ground for mixing soil in. Pretty straightforward.
kiln=This structure, built from mud and clay, can still reach temperatures sufficient to melt copper.
sandy-patch=A patch of relatively pure sand. Could be gathered up with the right tool.
wood-pipe=Carries fluids but not gases. Made from hollowed out wood.
wood-pump=A waterwheel made of wood and powered by wind, which can pump up small quantities of water.

[item-description]
basket=A simple basket woven from vines. Excellent for sifting and gathering sand.
charcoal=It has a higher fuel value than raw wood and can be used in smelting metals.
clay=A moldable material ideal as a primitive building material.
clay-dry=This dried-out clay will need to be mixed with other materials to become useful.
copper-axe=Significantly harder and sturdier than any stone tool, this axe lets you finally mine the ores you need to get to the next stage.
copper-bloom=It is a rough amelgamation of slag and bits of metallic copper that needs to be hammered out.
copper-crude=Metallic copper, but with a lot of impurities.
grate=A fired lump of clay with holes poked through, used for better fire ventilation.
jagged-rock=A single piece of stone with jagged edges. May be useful as a tool if properly shaped.
knapped-rock=This piece of stone has been carefully shaped using another piece of stone to give it a useful shape for tools.
malachite=Looks like a copper-rich rock. How to get the copper out though?
sand=Relatively pure sand. Can be used to even out ground for building.
stone-axe=A simple axe made from a knapped rock tied to a wood stick.
stone-hammer=Basically a rock shaped specifically for hammering stuf into shape.
stone-shovel=The tool of choice for digging stuf up. Just a bit more primitive.
vines=Some indiginous sort of creeper plant. Will serve as a substitute for rope.
wood-stick=The original multi-tool. But in this natural state it may be too blunt for use.
wood-stick-sharp=New and improved. Now with a point sharp enough to cut stuff loose.
wood-stick-fire-hardened=By charring the sharp end of the stick, it has become hard enough for tough jobs.

[recipe-description]
basket=Take some vines and lay them in a star pattern. Now weave some other vines in and out and voila: you have a basket.
campfire=Even the ground with sand, then build a steady campfire out of wood sticks.
charcoal=Burn raw wood in an oxygen-deprived environment to make charcoal.
charcoal-pile=Make a heap of raw wood, bury it in soil, and you have a charcoal pile.
clay-mixing=Before clay can be used for building, you need to mixing it with water.
copper-axe=Hammer your crude copper into the shape of an axe, insert stick into hole, and you get your first metal tool.
copper-bloom=Put your ore between layers of charcoal in the kiln, blow the fire high, then after a while take out the bloom at the bottom.
copper-crude=Heat and hammer at the bloom to drive of the slag until only somewhat pure copper remains.
grate=Take some clay, poke holes in it, then fire it, and you will have a great grate.
mixing-pit=Take a shovel and start digging. It does not get much easier.
kiln=Dig a hole, put the grate over it, raise walls of clay, and stoke a fire inside to make a kiln.
rock-knapping=Use one rock to hit another rock until it gets the shape you want. Rocks may break, though.
stone-axe=Take a study wooden stick, make a hole, put a shaped rock in it, tie it all with vine, and you get your very first axe.
stone-hammer=It is pretty easy to make a stone hammer. Just take a rock and shape it with a smooth, blunt end.
stone-shovel=It is not easy to tie a shaped rock lengthwise to a wooden stick to make a shovel, but it can be done.
wood-pipe=Take some wood, cut it in two, hollow it out, and raise it on sticks, and you have a primitive pipe.
wood-pump=Tie enough sticks and vines together and you get something approaching a waterwheel.
wood-stick-sharpen=You take one stick, and rub it against another stick, until you make a sharp point or a stick breaks.
wood-stick-fire-harden=Stick a sharpened stick in a fire, char its end, and it will become much harder.
