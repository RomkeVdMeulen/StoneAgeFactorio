stoneage-msg-intro=So, you are going to need to build a rocket to get out of here. You'll need the right tools to do that, but right now you have only your bare hands. Now let's see... what around here looks fragile enough that you can break it down with just your hands?

[entity-name]
campfire=Campfire
clay-patch=Clay patch
sandy-patch=Sandy patch

[entity-description]
campfire=A managable fireplace that can be used for some simple crafting, or to hopefully keep biters away.
clay-patch=This terrain is rich in dried up clay. With the right tool, it could easily be dug up.
sandy-patch=A patch of relatively pure sand. Could be gathered up with the right tool.

vines=Vines
wood-stick=Wooden stick
wood-stick-sharp=Sharpened wooden stick
wood-stick-fire-hardened=Fire-hardened wooden stick

[item-description]
basket=A simple basket woven from vines. Excellent for sifting and gathering sand.
clay=A moldable material ideal as a primitive building material.
clay-dry=This dried-out clay will need to be mixed with other materials to become useful.
jagged-rock=A single piece of stone with jagged edges. May be useful as a tool if properly shaped.
knapped-rock=This piece of stone has been carefully shaped using another piece of stone to give it a useful shape for tools.
malachite=Looks like a copper-rich rock. How to get the copper out though?
sand=Relatively pure sand. Can be used to even out ground for building.
stone-axe=A simple axe made from a knapped rock tied to a wood stick.
stone-hammer=Basically a rock shaped specifically for hammering stuf into shape.
stone-shovel=The tool of choice for digging stuf up. Just a bit more primitive.
vines=Some indiginous sort of creeper plant. Will serve as a substitute for rope.
wood-stick=The original multi-tool. But in this natural state it may be too blunt for use.
wood-stick-sharp=New and improved. Now with a point sharp enough to cut stuff loose.
wood-stick-fire-hardened=By charring the sharp end of the stick, it has become hard enough for tough jobs.

[recipe-name]
basket=Basket weaving
campfire=Campfire
rock-knapping=Rock knapping
stone-axe=Stone axe
stone-hammer=Stone hammer
stone-shovel=Stone shovel
wood-stick-sharpen=Sharpening wooden sticks
wood-stick-fire-harden=Fire-harden wood stick

[recipe-description]
basket=Take some vines and lay them in a star pattern. Now weave some other vines in and out and voila: you have a basket.
campfire=Even the ground with sand, then build a steady campfire out of wood sticks.
rock-knapping=Use one rock to hit another rock until it gets the shape you want. Rocks may break, though.
stone-axe=Take a study wooden stick, make a hole, put a shaped rock in it, tie it all with vine, and you get your very first axe.
stone-hammer=It is pretty easy to make a stone hammer. Just take a rock and shape it with a smooth, blunt end.
stone-shovel=It is not easy to tie a shaped rock lengthwise to a wooden stick to make a shovel, but it can be done.
wood-stick-sharpen=You take one stick, and rub it against another stick, until you make a sharp point or a stick breaks.
wood-stick-fire-harden=Stick a sharpened stick in a fire, char its end, and it will become much harder.
