stoneage-intro=So, you are going to need to build a rocket to get out of here. You'll need the right tools to do that, but right now you have only your bare hands. Now let's see... what around here looks fragile enough that you can break it down with just your hands?
anvil-cannot-be-opened=The anvil cannot be opened. Simply place materials and press __CONTROL__hammer-key__ to apply hammer.
anvil-no-hammer=You have no hammer to use.

[entity-description]
anvil=Place metal blooms into this with __CONTROL__fast-entity-transfer__ and press __CONTROL__hammer-key__ to start hammering.
campfire=Used for crafting that involves fire.
charcoal-pile=Burns raw wood and produces charcoal.
clay-patch=This terrain is rich in dried up clay. With the right tool, it could easily be dug up.
kiln=Uses charcoal to smelt ores into crude metals.
mixing-pit=Can be used to mix soils like dry clay.
sandy-patch=A patch of relatively pure sand. Could be gathered up with the right tool.
wood-pipe=Carries fluids but not gases. Made from hollowed out wood.
wood-pump=A waterwheel made of wood and powered by wind, which can pump up small quantities of water.
wood-reservoir=Connect this to a water source and insert a container to fill it with water.

copper-crude=Metallic copper with lots of impurities.
copper-hammer=Used for hammering hot metal into shape.
copper-spear=Useless for mining, but does decent melee damage.
grate=Made from baked clay. Improves ventilation and lets fires reach higher temperatures. Used in kilns.
jagged-rock=A single piece of stone with jagged edges. Needs to knapped into a useful shape.
iron-bloom=A rough clump of slag and pieces of metallic iron that need to be hammered out.
iron-crude=Metallic iron, but with a lot of impurities. Used to make simple iron tools.
knapped-rock=A shaped piece of stone, used for building stone tools.
magnetite-flakes=Knocked off flakes of an iron-rich rock, which need to be smelted to get the iron out.
malachite-flakes=Knocked off flakes of a copper-rich rock, which need to be smelted to get the copper out.
sand=Relatively pure sand. Can be used to even out ground for building.
stone-axe=Lets you get raw wood rather than sticks from trees, and stone rather than rock from stone patches. Also lets you mine copper and iron patches.
stone-shovel=Stone tool used for digging up soil like sand and clay. Hold it in your hand and press __CONTROL__drop-cursor__ to dig a mixing pit.
vines=Some indiginous sort of creeper plant. Used as an ingredient to tie things.

[recipe-description]
iron-axe-from-crude=
iron-crude=To make crude iron from a bloom, put the bloom on an anvil and press __CONTROL__hammer-key__ to hammer.
