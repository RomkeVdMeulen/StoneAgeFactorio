stoneage-msg-intro=So, you are going to need to build a rocket to get out of here. You'll need the right tools to do that, but right now you have only your bare hands. Now let's see... what around here looks fragile enough that you can break it down with just your hands?

wood-pipe=Wooden pipe
wood-pump=Wooden pump

[entity-description]
campfire=Used for crafting that involves fire.
charcoal-pile=Burns raw wood and produces charcoal.
clay-patch=This terrain is rich in dried up clay. With the right tool, it could easily be dug up.
mixing-pit=Can be used to mix soils like dry clay.
kiln=Uses charcoal to smelt ores into crude metals.
sandy-patch=A patch of relatively pure sand. Could be gathered up with the right tool.
wood-pipe=Carries fluids but not gases. Made from hollowed out wood.
wood-pump=A waterwheel made of wood and powered by wind, which can pump up small quantities of water.

basket=Woven from vines, used to gather sand.
charcoal=Has a higher fuel value than raw wood and can be used in smelting metals.
clay=Used as a material in primitive buildings.
clay-dry=Needs to be mixed with water to make useful clay.
copper-axe=This tool lets you gather all the same resources as an iron axe, but is less durable.
copper-bloom=A rough clump of slag and pieces of metallic copper that need to be hammered out.
copper-crude=Metallic copper, but with a lot of impurities. Used to make simple copper tools.
grate=Made from baked clay. Improves ventilation and lets fires reach higher temperatures. Used in kilns.
jagged-rock=A single piece of stone with jagged edges. Needs to knapped into a useful shape.
knapped-rock=A shaped piece of stone, used for building stone tools.
malachite=A copper-rich rock, that needs to be smelted to get the copper out.
sand=Relatively pure sand. Can be used to even out ground for building.
stone-axe=Lets you get raw wood from trees, rather than sticks, and mine copper patches.
stone-hammer=Used for hammering hot metal into shape.
stone-shovel=Stone tool used for digging up soil like sand and clay. Drop it on the surface to dig a mixing pit.
vines=Some indiginous sort of creeper plant. Used as an ingredient to tie things.
wood-stick=Broken off branch, allows mining life trees.
wood-stick-sharp=Sharpened stick, lets you cut down vines from trees.
wood-stick-fire-hardened=A stick that has been hardened with fire. Allows you to mine rocks from stone patches.

mixing-pit=Can be used to mix soils like dry clay.
rock-knapping=Use one rock to hit another rock until it gets the shape you want. One or both rocks may break, though.
wood-stick-sharpen=You take one stick, and rub it against another stick, until you make a sharp point or a stick breaks.
