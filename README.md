# StoneAgeFactorio
A Factorio mod that introduces a new "Stone Age" stage before the burner / electricity stage.

## Why?
I like how Factorio's early game differs drastically from the rest in terms of gameplay. In stead of designing builds, you're running around hand-filling burner miners and smelters. Raw products like iron and copper plates are more something to achieve in small batches than continuous capacities to scale up. That's not to say that I would want to spend hours hand-crafting and baby-sitting miners, but I like the variation.

I want to extend this early stage and add even more variation in gameplay. The goal is to introduce a "Stone Age" stage that comes before burner miners, with gameplay distinctly different from vanilla early game. Specifically, it should be even harder: I want your first pick-axe and your first burner-miner to feel like as much an achievement as your first assembler.

## Status
I'm currently working on an alpha version that showcases the gameplay. It has a lot of placeholder graphics and sounds that will eventually need to be replaced with original content.

## Want to help?
Great! I'm currently recruiting alpha testers: just add a comment on [this issue](https://github.com/StoneAgeFactorio/StoneAgeFactorio/issues/4) if you'd like to play-test this mod.

I'm also looking for help with creating original graphics and sounds for the mod. If you'd like to help with that, please send me a message.
